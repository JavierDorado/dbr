General

           Added __init__.py file to avoid import error when trying to import dbr.dbr.

           entry point for DBR not dbr.py.

           Mark some missing strings for translation. Added control + space 
           for play/pause functionality, and control + n control + shift n 
           for page down and page up respectively.

           Mark menu string for translation. Reorganize some menus.

           Initial support for internacionalization. This provides call to _ function for every module.
